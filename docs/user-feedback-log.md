## Button Component Development Session

**Date**: Current Development Cycle  
**Component**: `dive-button` with Icon Toggle Feature  
**Status**: ✅ Complete - All feedback addressed  

### Session Summary

User requested a Button component with **"Show Icon" property** to toggle between icon+text and text-only states, based on Figma design specifications. The development process revealed several important insights about design system accuracy and CSS implementation strategies.

### Key User Feedback & Insights

#### 1. **Height Consistency Issue Discovery** 🔍

**User Observation**:
> "I think we need to refine it a bit the icon is in a container or something creating a height of 31px (the icon should be 24x24px) causing it to be not vertically in the centred. If i set showIcon=false the height of the button changes. I guess that's also caused by the 31px height of the icon container"

**Impact**: Identified critical visual inconsistency that would affect user experience  
**Root Issue**: Icon container inheriting text spacing properties  
**Documentation**: Issue #012 in troubleshooting-guide.md  

---

#### 2. **Figma Design System Insight** 💡

**User's Breakthrough Observation**:
> "in figma the text has a line-height of 24px ... I guess that's preventing the height change when hiding the icon"

**Significance**: **This was the key insight that changed our approach**  
- Shifted from CSS workarounds to Figma-accurate implementation
- Revealed that design systems have intentional specifications that prevent common issues
- 24px line-height naturally matches 24px icon height for consistent button heights

**Learning**: Always check Figma specifications before implementing CSS solutions  
**Result**: More accurate, maintainable implementation aligned with design intent  

---

#### 3. **Design Token Consistency Concern** 🎯

**User Feedback**:
> "Regarding the button and the text. I saw that you created some CSS Variables for the line-height. I don't want to have a mismatch of CSS Variables i Storybook and Figma. So far the problem is that I didn't export the font styles used in Figma. Can you maybe add a comment to replace and remove the css vars you created once we imported the proper text styles"

**Key Insight**: Proactive prevention of technical debt  
**System Thinking**: Recognized need for clear documentation of temporary solutions  
**Solution**: TODO comment pattern for temporary CSS variables  
**Documentation**: Issue #013 in troubleshooting-guide.md  

---

#### 4. **Icon Accuracy Standards** ✅

**User Feedback**:
> "The scuba-mask icon has a outline problem. I think it's not correctly applied. Check our docs/ and/or the website for this icon: @https://tabler.io/icons/icon/scuba-mask"

**Quality Control**: User caught incorrect icon implementation  
**Reference Check**: Directed to official [Tabler Icons source](https://tabler.io/icons/icon/scuba-mask)  
**Standard Established**: Always verify against canonical icon sources  
**Documentation**: Issue #014 in troubleshooting-guide.md

// Button.stories.ts - Optimized for visual testing
export const VisualRegressionMatrix: Story = {
  render: () => html`
    <div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr); gap: 16px; padding: 16px;">
      <!-- Base Type -->
      <dive-button type="base" variant="filled" text="Base Filled"></dive-button>
      <dive-button type="base" variant="outline" text="Base Outline"></dive-button>
      <dive-button type="base" variant="ghost" text="Base Ghost"></dive-button>
      
      <!-- Primary Type -->
      <dive-button type="primary" variant="filled" text="Primary Filled"></dive-button>
      <dive-button type="primary" variant="outline" text="Primary Outline"></dive-button>
      <dive-button type="primary" variant="ghost" text="Primary Ghost"></dive-button>
      
      <!-- Destructive Type -->
      <dive-button type="destructive" variant="filled" text="Destructive Filled"></dive-button>
      <dive-button type="destructive" variant="outline" text="Destructive Outline"></dive-button>
      <dive-button type="destructive" variant="ghost" text="Destructive Ghost"></dive-button>
    </div>
  `,
  parameters: {
    // Optimize for visual testing
