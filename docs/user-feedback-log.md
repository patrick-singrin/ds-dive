## Button Component Development Session

**Date**: Current Development Cycle  
**Component**: `dive-button` with Icon Toggle Feature  
**Status**: ✅ Complete - All feedback addressed  

### Session Summary

User requested a Button component with **"Show Icon" property** to toggle between icon+text and text-only states, based on Figma design specifications. The development process revealed several important insights about design system accuracy and CSS implementation strategies.

### Key User Feedback & Insights

#### 1. **Height Consistency Issue Discovery** 🔍

**User Observation**:
> "I think we need to refine it a bit the icon is in a container or something creating a height of 31px (the icon should be 24x24px) causing it to be not vertically in the centred. If i set showIcon=false the height of the button changes. I guess that's also caused by the 31px height of the icon container"

**Impact**: Identified critical visual inconsistency that would affect user experience  
**Root Issue**: Icon container inheriting text spacing properties  
**Documentation**: Issue #012 in troubleshooting-guide.md  

---

#### 2. **Figma Design System Insight** 💡

**User's Breakthrough Observation**:
> "in figma the text has a line-height of 24px ... I guess that's preventing the height change when hiding the icon"

**Significance**: **This was the key insight that changed our approach**  
- Shifted from CSS workarounds to Figma-accurate implementation
- Revealed that design systems have intentional specifications that prevent common issues
- 24px line-height naturally matches 24px icon height for consistent button heights

**Learning**: Always check Figma specifications before implementing CSS solutions  
**Result**: More accurate, maintainable implementation aligned with design intent  

---

#### 3. **Design Token Consistency Concern** 🎯

**User Feedback**:
> "Regarding the button and the text. I saw that you created some CSS Variables for the line-height. I don't want to have a mismatch of CSS Variables i Storybook and Figma. So far the problem is that I didn't export the font styles used in Figma. Can you maybe add a comment to replace and remove the css vars you created once we imported the proper text styles"

**Key Insight**: Proactive prevention of technical debt  
**System Thinking**: Recognized need for clear documentation of temporary solutions  
**Solution**: TODO comment pattern for temporary CSS variables  
**Documentation**: Issue #013 in troubleshooting-guide.md
